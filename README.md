## Abstract

Solving combinatorial optimisation (CO) problems efficiently is an important challenge that spans various
domains. In this report, we investigate and compare two prominent meta-heuristic approaches to tackle CO
problems: simulated annealing (SA) and quantum annealing (QA). We use a 16-city instance of the Travelling
Salesman Problem (TSP) as a test example and solve it via standard Monte Carlo SA and path-integral Monte
Carlo (PIMC) QA. We determine the range of initial temperature $T_0$ for SA, as well as the ranges of Trotter
number $P$ and ambient temperature $T$ for QA, that yield the most efficient and accurate results through studies of the dependence of the final residual length on each methodâ€™s parameters. The superiority of PIMC QA relative to SA is demonstrated, for this TSP, with a study of the dependence of the final residual length on the total number of Monte Carlo steps. These results suggest QA could be an even better general-purpose CO meta-heuristic than SA. Future areas of investigation for QA and quantum optimisation as a whole are suggested.
